### League ID and season

**On a phone:** Open the league in the Yahoo Fantasy app and copy the league ID from league info, or share the league link and copy the number after `/f1/`. Use the latest season the league played.

**On a computer:** Open the league at `football.fantasysports.yahoo.com`. Copy the digits after `/f1/` in the address bar, then choose the latest season the league played. A URL like `/2025/f1/123456` is season 2025 and league ID 123456.

### Y and T cookies

**On a phone:** The normal iPhone and Android browser menus do not expose these cookie values. Get the League ID on the phone, but use a signed-in desktop browser for the two cookies.

**On a computer (Chrome or Edge):**

1. Sign in at `football.fantasysports.yahoo.com` and open the private league.
2. Open Developer Tools (`F12`, or right-click and select **Inspect**).
3. Select **Application → Storage → Cookies**, then the Yahoo origin.
4. Filter for `Y`; copy its **Value** into **Yahoo Y cookie**.
5. Filter for `T`; copy its **Value** into **Yahoo T cookie**.

In Firefox, use **Developer Tools → Storage → Cookies**. In Safari on Mac, enable developer features, then use **Develop → Show Web Inspector → Storage → Cookies**.

Treat both values like passwords. Never paste them into chat or send them to another person. This importer sends them only to Yahoo, never logs or shared-caches them, and clears both fields after a successful load. Use private import only on a deployment you trust.

If Yahoo still denies access, ask the commissioner to make the league publicly viewable and use the Public importer instead.

### On a phone

1. Open the league in the Sleeper app.
2. Tap the settings icon, then open **General**.
3. Scroll to the bottom of General League Settings and tap **Copy League ID**.
4. Paste that number into **Sleeper League ID** below.

### On a computer

1. Sign in at [sleeper.app](https://sleeper.app/) and open the league.
2. Copy the numeric league ID at the end of the page URL. It is usually the number after `/leagues/`.
3. Paste only that number below.

### League ID and season

**On a phone:** In the ESPN Fantasy app, open the league, select the **League** tab, then **League Info**. Copy the League ID shown there. Use the latest season the league played; for an inactive league, use its final active season.

**On a computer:** Open the league at `fantasy.espn.com`. Copy the digits after `leagueId=` in the address bar, then choose the latest season the league played.

### SWID and espn_s2

**On a phone:** The normal iPhone and Android browser menus do not expose these cookie values. Get the League ID on the phone, but use a signed-in desktop browser for the two cookies. Remote phone inspection still requires a computer, and iPhone inspection requires a Mac.

**On a computer (Chrome or Edge):**

1. Sign in at `fantasy.espn.com` and open the private league.
2. Open Developer Tools (`F12`, or right-click and select **Inspect**).
3. Select **Application → Storage → Cookies**, then the `fantasy.espn.com` origin.
4. Filter for `SWID`; copy its **Value** into **ESPN SWID cookie**.
5. Filter for `espn_s2`; copy its **Value** into **ESPN espn_s2 cookie**.

In Firefox, use **Developer Tools → Storage → Cookies**. In Safari on Mac, enable developer features, then use **Develop → Show Web Inspector → Storage → Cookies**.

Treat both values like passwords. Never paste them into chat or send them to another person. This importer sends them only to ESPN, never logs or shared-caches them, and clears both fields after a successful load. Use private import only on a deployment you trust.

[ESPN's League ID guide](https://support.espn.com/hc/en-us/articles/4669614193556-League-ID) · [Chrome cookie instructions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/application/cookies/)

### On a phone

1. Open the league in the ESPN Fantasy app.
2. Select the **League** tab, then **League Info**.
3. Copy the League ID shown there and paste it below.
4. Set **Most recent season** to the latest season the league played. For an inactive league, use its final active season.

### On a computer

1. Open the league at `fantasy.espn.com`.
2. Copy the digits after `leagueId=` in the address bar. An ESPN invite or league email link contains the same value.
3. Paste that number below and choose the latest season the league played.

### If ESPN denies public access

Here, **Public** uses ESPN's **viewable to public** setting. Your League Manager exposes league pages with this setting; ESPN keeps membership invite-only. The League Manager can enable it on a computer under **League → Settings → Basic Settings → Edit Basic Settings**. Otherwise, switch this importer to **Private** and use the signed-in browser instructions.
